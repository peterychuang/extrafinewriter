As much as I prefer Japanese fountain pens for their nibs with finer lines, there are a few compromises, one of which is the lack of "fancier" filling systems. Most Japanese fountain pens use proprietary cartridges or converters, even in some of the more expensive models. Pilot, to my knowledge, only has two models which don't use cartridges/converters. One of them is Custom Heritage 823, which utilises a vacuum filling system. The other one, and the subject of this review, is Custom Heritage 92, which is a piston filler.

### Design

Japanese pens aren't known for being adventurous in their designs, and most Japanese pens seem to fall into the "boring black pens" category, which I don't mind a great deal, as what I care about most is how it writes. Though I do have a soft spot for clear demonstrator pens, and that makes Pilot Custom Heritage 92 an attractive pen for me.

### Nib

Pilot Custom Heritage 92 comes with only three nib options--Fine, Medium, and Broad--which are limited relative to some other Pilot pen models, such as Pilot Custom Heritage 91. That is a real shame that the two Pilot models which have the "fancier" filling systems--Custom Heritage 92 and Custom Heritage 823--have the least nib options available.

The one I have comes with a 14k Gold, rhodium plated Fine nib. Given that I tended to favour Japanese Extra Fine nib, I was worried that the Fine nib in this pen wouldn't be fine enough. To my surprise, however, this pen's F nib gives a similar line width as Platinum #3776 EF nib.

The nib is quite springy when compared with the EF nib on Platinum #3776, and it does give some line variations. I don't think the EF nib on Platinum #3776 is scratchy, though the Pilot F nib is quite a bit smoother.
